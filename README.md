## Welcome to my Smart Watch Project

This Project was started May 2017 and is still being worked on.

### Current Status:
* Currently the watch has undergone 1 prototype.
* 2nd prototype in the process of being fabbed.
* Case for the watch is being designed to be 3D printed

### Initial goals for this project are:
* Working screen
* Actual simple watch functionality
* Computer to watch communication (SPI, UART)
* Bluetooth connectivity to phone 
    * Notifications
    * Probably going to need to make an app for full functionality
* Decent battery life (6 hours)
* Ability to charge easily from usb

### Extra goals:
* SOS signal
    ** Being able to send a text with GPS coordinates to emergency contact, using only the watch 
* LTE connectivity
* Accelerometer
