## Welcome to my Smart Watch Project

This Project was started May 2017 and is still being worked on.
For more detailed Information check out the [wiki](https://github.com/mrfrankism/SmartWatch/wiki)

### Current Status:
* Currently the watch has undergone 2 prototypes.
* 2nd Prototype spin: <img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/13021723/32009313-c3745986-b97c-11e7-9400-179ad1422d44.jpg" width="120" height="240">
* The 2nd prototype was fabbed with the incorrecct package for the atmega328, so the 3rd spin will fix this issue without adding new       features for now
* Case for the watch is being designed to be 3D printed

### Initial goals for this project are:
* Working screen
* Actual simple watch functionality
* Computer to watch communication (SPI, UART)
* Bluetooth connectivity to phone 
* Notifications
* Probably going to need to make an app for full bluetooth-notification functionality
* Decent battery life (6 hours)
* Ability to charge easily from usb

### Extra goals:
* SOS signal - Being able to send a text with GPS coordinates to emergency contact, using only the watch 
* LTE connectivity
* Accelerometer
* Gyro
* Wifi?
* GPS
